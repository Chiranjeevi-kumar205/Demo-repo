## addition of two numbers
In Python, adding two numbers involves using the `+` operator between them. This operation can be performed on integers, floats, or a combination of both. When you add two numbers, Python processes the addition and returns the sum. This is a basic operation and is foundational in programming with Python. Here's a simple example:

```python
number1 = 5
number2 = 3
sum = number1 + number2
print(sum)
```

This script will output `8`, the sum of 5 and 3.
